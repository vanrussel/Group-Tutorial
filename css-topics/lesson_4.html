      <h2>Lesson 4: The Box Model</h2>
      <h1 id="content-ONE">Introduction to CSS</h1>
      <p>
        Now that you understand the basic syntax of HTML and CSS, we’re going to
        get serious. The most important skills you need to master with CSS are
        positioning and layout. Changing fonts and colors is a crucial skill,
        but being able to put things exactly where you want them on a webpage is
        even more crucial. After all, how many webpages can you find where
        absolutely every element is just stacked one on top of another? Learning
        to position elements on a webpage is not that difficult once you
        understand just a few key concepts. Unfortunately, many learners race
        through learning HTML and CSS to get to JavaScript and end up missing
        these fundamental concepts. This leads to frustration and pain (and
        funny gifs) because all the JavaScript skills in the world are
        meaningless if you can’t stick your elements on the page where you need
        them to be. So with that in mind, let’s get started.

      <h2 id="content-THREE">The box model</h2>
      <p>
        The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful
        in CSS is the box model. It isn’t complicated, but skipping over it now
        would cause you much frustration down the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can
        have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another. You can get
        a rough idea of how this works by applying an outline to every element
        on the page like this:
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre><code>
          * {
            outline: 2px solid red;
          }
        </code></pre>

      <p>
        You can use the browser’s inspector to add the CSS above to this web
        page if you want, by clicking the + button in the top right of the
        “Styles” panel within the “Elements” tab. Boxes in boxes!
      </p>

      />

        OK, so there might be some circles in the above image… but when it comes
        to layout, they fit together like rectangular boxes and not circles. In
        the end, laying out a webpage and positioning all its elements is
        deciding how you are going to nest and stack these boxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only real complication here is that there are many ways to
        manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using
        padding, border, and margin. The assigned articles go into more depth on
        this concept, but to sum it up briefly:
      </p>

      <br />

      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Padding</strong> increases the space between the border of a
            box and the content of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Border</strong> adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or
            two) between the margin and the padding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Margin</strong> increases the space between the borders of a
            box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>Be sure to study the diagrams carefully.</p>
